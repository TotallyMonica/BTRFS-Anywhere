Problem: I'm unable to connect to my samba server
Solution: Make sure that you have the correct IP (typically run ip a) in the virtual machine.

Problem: My shares aren't showing any data
Solution: Make sure that your drives are mounted (run lsblk), your shares are pointing to the right directory (run editsmb and editfstab)

Problem: When creating mountpoints, it keeps asking for my password
Solution: Make sure you ran as root, typically prefacing it with sudo. 

Problem: After creating my mountpoints, my shares aren't showing up, data isn't showing up, or other misc issues.
Solution: Rebooting your VM will cause most things to kick into action, but if you cannot reboot the VM then try running mountall then restartsmb.
